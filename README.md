## What I learned from this project :
This was my first React project where I learnt how to use basics React components and hooks such as **useState** and **useEffect**
 
This App consumes data from a **public API** ( https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/ )


One of the hardest challenges was the SearchInput, learnt about Javascript functions such as **.filter and .include.**

 
As for the styling, I tried multiple CSS frameworks, in the end **Material-UI** was the one that felt more natural.

## TODO :
- ~~Heavy styling rework~~
- Filter refactor
- Clickable cards to display more infos
